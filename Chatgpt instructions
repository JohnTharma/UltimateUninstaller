A working utf 8 batch script with software name,newversion, and silent parameters set. The script should first look if software name matches displayname in 32bit registry, else check 64bit registry. If exist in either, should check if the display version is greater than or equal to newversion. If not, echo old version installed and proceed to uninstall with the uninstallstring found in the registry and add the silent parametersset, else echo newer version is detected and exit script.
